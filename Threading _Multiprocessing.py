# Threading vs. Multiprocessing

# Use Threading when waiting for external resources
# Use Multiprocessing for CPU-Heavy Tasks


# GIL(Globle Interpreter Lock)

# Python GIL allows only one thread to excute Python bytecode at a time.

# This allow True Parallel Execution in Multithreading.


# Process Pool & Thread Pool Executors (concurrent.futures)

# This provide High level Api to Manage threads and processes effciently.


# asyncio â€“ Asynchronous Programming in Python ðŸš€

# asyncio is python library that helps write concurrent code using the async/await and its mainly Userd for I/O bound Task.

#  I/O bound task is a task that spends most of its time waiting for input/output (I/O) operations to complete. 

# also using in 

# Networking 
# Database Queries
# File I/O
# Asynchronous event loops.


# Understading of Async and Await
