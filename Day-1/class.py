# A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects and defining methods
# objects - objects is instance of class
#object oriented programming - Object oriented programming is the way to write the well structure and scalable code. there are four principle of object oriented programming.

# 1. Encapsulation
# 2. Abstraction
# 3. Inheritance
# 4. Polymorphism

# 1. Encapsulation

# Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class) 
# and restricting access to some attributes using access modifiers.

# Access Modifiers:
# - Private (`__variable`): Accessible only within the class.
# - Protected (`_variable`): Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
# - Public (`variable`): Accessible throughout the code.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# 1. Abstraction - 
# Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details from the user and exposing only essential features.
# It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, simplifying complexity.

# Summary: Why Abstraction?

# Hides Complexity	Users only see what they need.
# Reusability	Same structure can be used for different implementations.
# Maintainability	Changing one part doesn‚Äôt break the whole system.
# Loose Coupling	System is more flexible and modular.
# Security	Prevents unwanted access to internal details.

    @abstractmethod

# üîπ Inheritance in OOP
# Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (child) to inherit the methods and properties of another class (parent). This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.

# üî∏ Why Use Inheritance?
# Code Reusability ‚Äì Avoid rewriting the same code.
# Reduces Redundancy ‚Äì Define common logic in a base class and reuse it.
# Extensibility ‚Äì Easily extend existing functionality.
# Maintains Consistency ‚Äì Follows the DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principle.

# üî∏ Types of Inheritance in Python
# 1 Single Inheritance ‚Äì One class inherits from another.
# 2Ô∏è Multiple Inheritance ‚Äì A class inherits from multiple parent classes.
# 3Ô∏è Multilevel Inheritance ‚Äì A class inherits from a class that is already inherited.
# 4Ô∏è Hierarchical Inheritance ‚Äì Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent.
# 5Ô∏è Hybrid Inheritance ‚Äì Combination of multiple inheritance types.



class Parent:
    def get_amount(self):
        return 1000
    
    
class child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
    def check_balance(self):
        return self.get_amount()
    
    
object = child()
print(object.check_balance())



# Polymorphism is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where one interface, method, or function can be used in multiple ways. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same method call.

# Types of Polymorphism
# 1Ô∏è Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism ‚Äì Achieved using Method Overloading (not supported in Python).
# 2Ô∏è Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism ‚Äì Achieved using Method Overriding.

#  In Python, we don‚Äôt check the object's type; instead, we check if it has the required behavior.


#Method Overloading user *args

class operations:
    def addition(self,*args):
        return sum(args)

    
obj = operations()
print(obj.addition(2,5))
print(obj.addition(2,5,9,0,11))



#Method Overiding

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass
    
    
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Bark"   #change or Extend the behavior of class
    
    
class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

#MRO - Method Resolution Order

# *MRO defines method inheritence order * in multiple inheritence

#How MRO Works  Orders- 

# 1. Child Class First
# 2. left to right(for multiple inheritance)
# 3. Depth First (Without Repeating Classes) 


class Person:
    def show(self):
        return "I am Person"
        
class Employee(Person):
    def show(self):
        return "I am Employee"
    
    
class Director(Person):
    def show(self):
        return "I am Director"
        
        

obj  = Person()
print(obj.show())
print(Employee.__mro__)

# Static Method and Class Method @Property

# Static Method (Independent Helper Methods)- It is the method inside the class but does not access of self or cls. it behave like a regular method which logically grouped whithin class.
# usecase - used as helper or utility fuction which does not depend on instane.
# can be called class itself or using instance.
 
 
# Class Methods - (class level methods)  

# When working with class-level data.
# As an alternative constructor to create instances in different ways.
# To modify shared class attributes across all instances.
# For implementing factory methods to return different subclasses dynamically.

obj = Employee("Jon",17)

obj2 = Employee.from_birth_year("ron",1928)

print(obj.__dict__)

# @Property - when you want to restrict direct access from instance varibles
 #Want to Control attribute access  We can implement
